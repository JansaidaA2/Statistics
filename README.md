Project Title: Retail Sales Data Analysis
Description
The Retail Sales Data Analysis project is designed to analyze sales data for various product categories in a retail store. This application provides insights into sales performance through descriptive and inferential statistics, as well as visualizations that help in understanding the distribution of units sold across different categories.

Features
Data Generation: Synthetic sales data is generated for analysis, including product IDs, names, categories, units sold, and sale dates.
Descriptive Statistics: The application calculates and displays key statistics such as mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation of units sold.
Category Statistics: Sales data is grouped by product category to provide total and average units sold, along with standard deviation for each category.
Inferential Statistics: Confidence intervals for the mean units sold are calculated at both 95% and 99% confidence levels.
Hypothesis Testing: A t-test is performed to determine if the mean units sold significantly differs from a specified value (20 in this case).
Visualizations: The application includes various visualizations such as histograms, boxplots, and bar plots to illustrate the distribution of units sold and sales performance by category.
